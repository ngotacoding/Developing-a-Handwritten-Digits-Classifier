# Handwritten Digits Classifier

This is the second project in the AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree by Udacity. 

## Overview
The project focuses on developing a proof of concept for OCR on handwritten digits. It preprocesses the dataset, constructs and trains a neural network using PyTorch, and evaluates the neural network, achieving a test accuracy of 95%.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset comprises images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Project Structure
The project repository contains the following files:
- `main.ipynb`: Main notebook for developing the classifier.
- `README.md`: Project overview.


## Dependencies
This project utilises numpy, matplotlib, and pytorch running on jupyter notebook.  
Ensure ipywidgets is also installed

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib jupyterlab ipywidgets
```
